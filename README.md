These are my i3 window manager configs in Ubuntu

# Requirements

```bash
sudo apt install i3 picom feh rofi dunst parcellite arc-theme sway
```

```bash
pip3 install wal
```

# Usage

- Put the contents of **config** directory, into your **~/.config/**.

- Put the directory **rofi** into **~/.config/** too.

- Put the **fonts** into **~/.fonts/**.

- Put an image file in **~/Pictures/** named **background.jpg**.

- Put the **gtkrc-2.0** file in $HOME with the name **.gtkrc-2.0**.

- Put the **config/gtk-3.0** directory in **~/.config/**.

# Notes in colorscheme

- The colorscheme is generated by **wal**. You can change the colorscheme by changing the image in **~/Pictures/background.jpg** and running `wal -i ~/Pictures/background.jpg`.

- The colorscheme is applied to i3, rofi, dunst, and gtk3.

This way, we get a dynamic colorscheme that changes with the wallpaper every time we call `wal`.

# Notes about multi-monitor

If something goes wrong and the second monitor is back, unassign and assign again its placement. Suppose you have it at your right of main screen, then swap it between left and the set to the right again.

```bash
# send to left, the opposite side
xrandr --output HDMI-1 --auto --left-of eDP-1
# send to the desired side
xrandr --output HDMI-1 --auto --right-of eDP-1
```

Looks annoying to do it, but solves quickly the issue... ;)
